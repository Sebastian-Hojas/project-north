We believe that today’s society and organisations need individuals who are rooted in their values and motivation. Having clarity on our internal drivers help us communicate them and thereby inspire others.
We believe that by sharing memorable and impactful moments of our lives we get valuable feedback about what truly matters to us.

# Process to get more clarity about one's values

To gain more clarity on our values, we have tested the following process with groups:

- **Preparation:** Creating a psychologically safe atmosphere that supports showing emotions and active listening. Listening exercises can help.
- **Selecting moments**: Selecting memorable moments from our past, ranging from inspiring people we have met to tough or pleasant memories. The aim is to choose very concrete moments.
- **Sharing memories**: In pairs or triplets people take turns in sharing stories (e.g. ~15min sharing, 10min reflection from the pair).
- **Collecting themes & hearing reflections**: The listeners share the values & themes they have noticed in what you shared.
- **Individual analysis on repeating themes**: What are the common themes in the stories that you have shared? What can you learn about your values and drivers?

# Example of an implementation
