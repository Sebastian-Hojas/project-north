Everyone has a different preference of how they want to be listened to. Therefore we strongly encourage the sharing with asking 

> How do you want to be listened to?

# Listening space we want to create

- Giving space to the person sharing
- Letting the person sharing steer the conversation
- 10-15min for sharing, 10 minutes for resonance and reflection from the listener.
